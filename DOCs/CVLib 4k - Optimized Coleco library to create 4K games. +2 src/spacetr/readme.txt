The Game:

You are space cadets and you are
now in the SPACE TRAINER virtual game.
In this game two cadets pilot a
spaceship and must use their agility
to hit the space bubbles as many as
possible to gain points. The bubbles
give you more points if they not stay
too long at the space place.

The first cadet to reach 10'000 pts
wins the game.

More Info:

Points for a space bubble :
 * minimum = 10 points
 * maximum = 600 points

Controls: 

Use normal joysticks to play

Move LEFT and RIGHT to rotate the ship
Press FIRE to use the propulsors.
